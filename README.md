# React Introduction

This are the projects that I developed while doing the course of React from freeCodeCamp. I did this course as preparation for my first job (an internship at upCamp as Front-End developer). My intention was not to make something function, but rather learn all I could about React.

### Reviews page

This is a clone of the freeCodeCamp.org reviews page.
The main thing I learned through this project was the creation of React components and a little bit about the use of props.

### Click counter

This is an app that contains 2 buttons and displays a click count. The count starts at 0 and goes up as you click the button that reeds 'click'. I took my first steeps into useState() with this project.

### Calculator

This is a calculator app with the main 4 operations (+, -, /, \*) and its combinations. I tried to contemplate all the border cases but I don't guarantee an execution without errors.

### Notes app

This is a notes app, were you can write, complete and delete notes with no character limit. It is the most complex project I build so far.

### Reviews page and Click counter with classes

This two projects where made to introduce myself into class components and how to work with them.
