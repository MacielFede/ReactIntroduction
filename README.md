# React Introduction

This are the projects that I developed while doing the course of React from freeCodeCamp. I did this course as preparation for my first job (an internship at upCamp as Front-End developer). My intention was not to make something function, but rather learn all I could about React.

This is a clone of the freeCodeCamp.org reviews page.
The main thing I learned through this project was the creation of React components and a little bit about the use of props.
